  desc: Hi! I am an engineering student at KTH, focusing on Computer Science with specialization
        in <i>Programming languages</i> and <i>Compilers</i>. I am reaching the end of my academic studies and
        am looking for jobs that can put my education and interests to use!<br/><br/>


        As an engineer, I like working with hardware close programming such as embedded systems and compilers.
        I also have an interest in languages from various design philosophies such as
        <i>C</i>, <i>Python</i> and <i>Haskell</i>.<br/><br/>


        In my spare time, I like to engage in student life, play musical instruments in
        different constellations, tinkering with my Linux OS and do weightlifting
